This study investigates Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) for solving the Minimum Latency Problem, comparing it with Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization. Findings show BBO’s performance varies by instance, with computation speed and tour cost advantages appearing inconsistently across cases.
